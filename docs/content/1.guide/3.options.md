`theme.options` is a plain object definition that gets processed by [untyped](https://github.com/unjs/untyped) to generate a type definition object.

This allows the options defined by the theme author in his `theme.options` key to be type-safe.

The theme user that will configure his theme via the same key or a `theme.config` file will get auto-completion from the configuration you defined.

### Defining theme options

There is two ways to define theme options:

- Via the `theme.options` key in the `nuxt.config` file.
- Via the `theme.config` file at the root of your project.

Both of these options will be merged an available via the `$theme` global property and `useTheme` in your app.

These two ways will both work for theme authors and theme users as they will get processed in order of priority (user configuration > theme defaults).

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineThemeConfig({
  theme: {
    options: {
      header: true,
      footer: {
        text: 'Made by NuxtLabs',
        credits: false
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```ts [theme.config.ts]
import { defineTheme } from '@nuxt-themes/config'

export default defineTheme({
  header: true,
  footer: {
    text: 'Made by NuxtLabs',
    credits: false
  }
})
```

### Consuming theme options

Theme options gets merged by [defu](https://github.com/unjs/defu) and a type gets generated from it by [untyped](https://github.com/unjs/untyped).

This merged object will get injected into your app and be available everywhere.

- **Composable usage**
  ```ts
  const theme = useTheme()

  const hasHeader = computed(() => !!theme.value.header)
  ```

- **`<template>` usage**
  ```vue
  <template>
  <header v-if="!!$theme.value.header">
    My Header
  </header>
  </template>
  ```

- **`server` usage**
  ```ts [server/api/theme-options.ts]
  export default defineHandler(() => {
    const { theme } = useRuntimeConfig().public

    return {
      theme
    }
  })
  ```

## Metas

`theme.meta` is only useful for Nuxt Theme Kit and other providers that need to parse and reference your theme.

It has no need to be accessed from a Nuxt environment, but gives the nice message saying which theme you are using when your app boots! âœ¨
