description: What makes @nuxt-themes/config useful.
---

Since Nuxt 3 introduced [extends]() feature, it is now possible to merge two or more Nuxt projects.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['@nuxt-themes/docus']
})
```

This feature is **extremely** powerful, especially if you are trying to implement a theming system.

What **@nuxt-themes/config** offers is **opt-in** features that makes the life of theme authors easier.

A theme differs from a regular Nuxt app as you might want to provide theme users some configurations keys that toggle settings in the theme UI or features.

Let's take an easy example on how @nuxt-themes/config helps with that.

1. Define the configuration option.
   ```ts [theme/theme.config.ts]
    export default defineThemeConfig({
      theme: {
        // Theme options
        options: {
          header: {
            title: 'My Theme'
          }
        },
        // Design Tokens
        tokens: {
          colors: {
            primary: '#A288A6'
          }
        }
      }
    })
   ```

2. Use the configuration key in your components.
   ```vue [layout/default.vue]
   <template>
   <!-- Template usage -->
   <main>
    <header v-if="hasHeader">
      <h1>{{ $theme.value.title }}</h1>
    </header>
   </main>
   </template>

   <script setup lang="ts">
   // Composable usage
   const theme = useTheme()
   const hasHeader = computed(() => theme.value.header)
   </script>
   ```

::alert
@nuxt-themes/config will automatically extract and generate a typing file from your theme options object.
<br/>
This ensures any access to your theme via `useTheme()` or `$theme` stays type-safe.

As for now, the theme only supports basic informations like `name` or `author`.

The objective behind theme metas is to prepare your theme to be ready for distribution on websites that might reference and categorize it.

It is also used to display the name of the theme to the user that uses it.
